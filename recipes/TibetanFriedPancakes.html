        <h4>Tibetan veg momo is a kind of traditional delicious food originated from Tibet. It's made with flavorings and some fresh vegetables and potatoes.</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <ls>Salts</ls>
                <ls>Fresh Vegetables</ls>
                <ls>Potatoes</ls>
                <ls>Rapeseed Oli</ls>
                <ls>Butters</ls>
                <ls>Hot sauces</ls>

            </ul>

        <h3>Steps<h3>
            <ol>
                
                <ls>Prepare a non-stick surface and a damp cloth or lid to keep the momos you've made from drying out while you’re finishing the others (lightly-greased trays of steamer with lid or wax paper and a damp cloth).</ls>
                </ls>Hold a dough circle in your left hand, slightly cupping it. Put about a tablespoon of your veggie filling in the center of the dough. Start with a small amount, try to not overfill.</ls>
                <ls>Starting on one edge and moving to the other, pinch the two sides of the dough together, creating a curved crescent shape. The bottom side of the momo will stay relatively flat, whereas the pinched edge has folds to allow for the bulk of the filling.  Be sure to close all gaps so that you don’t lose juice while cooking.</ls>
                
            </ol>
